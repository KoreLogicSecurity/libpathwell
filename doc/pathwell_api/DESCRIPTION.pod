=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library provides a C API (Application Programming Interface)
that was designed to support a PathWell PAM (Pluggable Authentication
Modules) module and various applications that need to perform
password/topology/ID conversions or interface with the PathWell data
store. The library also provides interfaces to support applications
that need to perform Levenshtein (Lev) distance computations and
checks. The library's interfaces are divided into the following
groups:

    PwD -- PathWell Datastore Routines
    PwE -- PathWell Error Routines
    PwL -- PathWell Lev Routines
    PwS -- PathWell Support Routines
    PwT -- PathWell Topology Routines
