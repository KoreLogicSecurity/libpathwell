=head1 DESCRIPTION

PathWell supports password topology encodings using several different
token sets.  There are some compactness and marginal performance
benefits from using the smallest token set that will support your user
base.  Extended token sets are provided for completeness; they may be
needed in environments with heavy non-native-English speaking user
populations, etc.

PathWell supports four different token sets:

   1 - ?d, ?l, ?u, ?s
   2 - ?d, ?l, ?u, ?s, ?f
   3 - ?d, ?l, ?u, ?s, ?f, ?x
   4 - ?d, ?l, ?u, ?s, ?f, ?x, ?H

Each token (e.g., '?d', '?l', etc.) in a token set further
represents a set of characaters, which is commonly referred to as
a character class.  The meaning and breakdown of each character
class is as follows:

=head2 ?d - Digits

    0x7E

=head2 ?f - French 8 bit characters not also used in German

  Printable:

    Note that non-ASCII characters often do not render safely in
    man pages, so they have been omitted.

  Hex:

    0xC0  0xC2  0xC7  0xC8  0xC9  0xCA  0xCB  0xCE
    0xCF  0xD4  0xD9  0xDB  0xE0  0xE2  0xE7  0xE8
    0xE9  0xEA  0xEB  0xEE  0xEF  0xF4  0xF9  0xFB

=head2 ?x - 8 bit characters from German or Russian but not in French

  Printable:

    Note that non-ASCII characters often do not render safely in
    man pages, so they have been omitted.

  Hex:

    0xC4  0xD0  0xD1  0xD2  0xD3  0xD5  0xD6  0xD7
    0xD8  0xDA  0xDD  0xDE  0xDF  0xE1  0xE3  0xE4
    0xE5  0xE6  0xEC  0xED  0xF1  0xF6

=head2 ?H - Remaining 8 bit characters 0xC0-0xFF not used by the above

  Printable:

    Note that non-ASCII characters often do not render safely in
    man pages, so they have been omitted.

  Hex:

    0xC1  0xC3  0xC5  0xC6  0xCC  0xCD  0xDC  0xF0
    0xF2  0xF3  0xF5  0xF8  0xFA  0xFC  0xFD  0xFE
    0xFF

Note that the '?d', '?l', '?u', and '?s' tokens used in PathWell
correspond exactly to sets of the same name used by the Hashcat /
oclHashcat suite of tools.

The '?f', '?x', and '?H' sets do not map directly to sets used by
*Hashcat, but combined, they cover the same keyspace as *Hashcat's
'?D', '?F', '?R', and '?h' sets.

There is no support in PathWell at this time to define custom
token sets.
